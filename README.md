# ‚úàÔ∏è Learning-Based Airline Delay Estimation

## üß† Overview
Flight delays are a persistent challenge in the aviation industry, impacting airline efficiency and passenger satisfaction.  
This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques using **Apache Spark** to predict flight delays based on large-scale flight data.

The objective is to build robust predictive models that can help airlines **anticipate delays**, optimize scheduling, and enhance the passenger experience.

## üìä Dataset
**Source:** U.S. Department of Transportation ‚Äî *Airline Delay Prediction Dataset (2014)*  
**Records:** 5,819,811  
**Attributes:** 18 features (numerical, categorical, temporal)  
**File Size:** ~300 MB (CSV)

Key attributes include:
- Flight times (DepTime, ArrTime)
- Delays (DepDelay, ArrDelay)
- WeatherDelay, CarrierDelay, NASDelay
- Distance, Carrier code, Origin, Destination
- Date, Month, Day of Week

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory analysis was performed to uncover:
- Delay trends across airports and routes
- Monthly and hourly delay distributions
- Contributions of delay causes (weather, carrier, etc.)
- Seasonal and regional delay variations

Key visualizations:
- U.S. airport delay heatmap  
- Flight network visualization  
- Top 15 delayed routes  
- Delay distribution by day/hour

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Replaced missing delay values (e.g., `CarrierDelay`, `WeatherDelay`) with `0`
   - Removed rows missing critical info like `DepTime` or `ArrTime`

2. **Addressing Class Imbalance**
   - Applied **oversampling** to minority (delayed) class  
   - Used **class weight adjustments** in models (e.g., Logistic Regression)

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created a binary *Delayed* target variable  
   - Added temporal features (Month, Day of Week)  
   - Categorized flight distances  
   - Encoded categorical features (e.g., airlines, airports)
